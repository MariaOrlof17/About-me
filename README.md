# About-me
When I started testing

My professional ambition is to start my career as a software QA engineer. Currently, I’m preparing to complete the ISTQB certificate. 
I’m an ambitious, detail-oriented person who enjoys developing and implementing process improvements. 
My past experience as a food technologist gave me a solid foundation that I plan to use in software quality assurance. During my previous job, I focused on improving the production process by identifying weaknesses and assuring that the product have the best quality possible.
I have completed a manual tester course with GoIT company, where I learned a lot of practical skills that I would like to use in work.
